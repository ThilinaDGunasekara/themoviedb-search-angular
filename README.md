This is a user interface for The Movie Databse search API written in Angular 4.

## About the project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.3.2. It uses Angular version 4 with Bootstrap ^3.3.7. Unit test were written using Jasmine and Karma the a test runner. Project is compatible with the official Angular 2/4 styleguide: https://angular.io/guide/styleguideBesides. Unit tests were written using Test-driven development (TDD). Project besides the main AppModule with app.component.ts and app.component.spec.ts (with unit tests) was divided into several modules with their own components/services:

- core - module with global services loaded once during application startup in the AppModule (services are singletons thus this module cannot be included anywhere else in the project)
- shared - module with shared components without services, the components placed in here can be reused (included multiple times) within a project. Public functions are documented using JSDoc.
- tmd-search - module with the search feature and user interface
  - config.json - API configuration file (enter your API key here)
  - search-query-parametrs.model.ts - Interface for the tmd-search.service with data structure
  - tmd-search.component.ts - Component which implements user interface for the search
  - tmd-search.component.spec.ts - Unit tests for the component
  - tmd-search.component.html - HTML template for the component
  - tmd-search.component.scss - SCSS/CSS styles for the HTML template
  - tmd.search.service.ts - Service responsible for handling HTTP communication via GET request with a search parameters
  - tmd.search.service.spec.ts - unit tests for the service

## Requirements

Node 6.9.0 or higher is required, together with NPM 3 or higher. To use below commands Angular CLI must be globally installed via `npm install -g @angular/cli`.

## Installation

After cloning this repo, run `npm install` in the project folder. Then you need to generate your own API key to access https://api.themoviedb.org/3. This key should be pasted in the '%project%/src/app/tmd-search/config.json' file, instead of \<key>. Now you can use below commands and test the app. To serve the app invoke `ng serve` in the project folder and navigate to `http://localhost:4200` in the browser. To run unit tests with Karma invoke `ng test`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
